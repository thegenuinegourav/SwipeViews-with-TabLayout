# SwipeViews-with-TabLayout  
An Android App which provides lateral navigation between sibling screens such as tabs with a horizontal finger gesture (i.e. horizontal paging) using ViewPager Widget and TabLayout(included in material design dependency).  
If it is helpful to you then follow me (you can give it a star too), I will make some more useful standard codes..  
Happy Coding :)
